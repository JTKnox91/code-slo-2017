                <p>Margaret Hamilton was a pinoneering computer scientist who led the Software Engineering Division for NASA's
                    Apollo missions. She was a brilliant mathematician, innovative programmer, and working mother. She literally invented the job title "Software Engineer."</p>
                    <p>In 2016 Ms. Hamilton was awarded the Presidental Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama for her service to NASA and the people of the United States of America.</p>

                    <p class="bio-section-body">Margaret Heafield was born in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (n√©e Partington).[7]
                        After graduating from Hancock High School in 1954, she started out in mathematics at the University
                        of Michigan in 1955 and subsequently earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from
                        Earlham College in 1958. She briefly taught high school mathematics and French upon graduation, in
                        order to support her husband while he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard, with the ultimate
                        goal of pursuing a graduate degree at a later time. She moved to Boston, Massachusetts, with the
                        intention of doing graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University. She cites a female
                        math professor as helping her desire to pursue abstract mathematics. She had other inspirations outside
                        the technological world, including her father, the philosopher and poet, and her grandfather, a school
                        headmaster and Quaker Minister. She says these men inspired her to a minor in philosophy. In 1960
                        she took an interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the LGP-30 and
                        the PDP-1 computers (at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC) for professor Edward Norton Lorenz in the meteorology
                        department. Hamilton wrote that <em>at that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.</em></p>
                    <p class="bio-section-body"> 1961 to 1963, she worked on the SAGE Project at Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who
                        wrote software for the first AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), to search for "unfriendly" aircraft; she
                        also wrote software for the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.</p>

                    <h2 class="bio-section-title">The Apollo Missions</h2>
                    <img class="bio-section-img" src="img/apollo-code.jpg" />
                    <p class="bio-section-body">Hamilton then joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT, which at the time was working on the
                        Apollo space mission. She eventually led a team credited with developing the software for Apollo
                        and Skylab. Hamilton's team was responsible for developing in-flight software, which included algorithms
                        designed by various senior scientists for the Apollo command module, lunar lander, and the subsequent
                        Skylab. Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software which included the error
                        detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (AKA the Priority
                        Displays) which Hamilton designed and developed. She worked to gain hands-on experience during a
                        time when computer science courses were uncommon and software engineering courses did not exist.</p>
                    <p class="bio-section-body">Her areas of expertise include systems design and software development, enterprise and process modelling,
                        development paradigm, formal systems modeling languages, system-oriented objects for systems modelling
                        and development, automated life-cycle environments, methods for maximizing software reliability and
                        reuse, domain analysis, correctness by built-in language properties, open-architecture techniques
                        for robust systems, full life-cycle automation, quality assurance, seamless integration, error detection
                        and recovery techniques, man-machine interface systems, operating systems, end-to-end testing techniques,
                        and life-cycle management techniques.</p>

                        <p class="bio-section-body">When Hamilton started using the term "software engineering", software engineering was not taken seriously compared to other engineering; nor was it regarded as a science. She began to use the term "software engineering" during the early Apollo missions in order to give software the legitimacy of other fields such as hardware engineering. Over time the term "software engineering" has gained the same respect as any other discipline. "At MIT she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer". Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting humans to the moon. Hamilton, along with many other female engineers alike, challenged the male dominated technology field of their time, to allow for women to enter in these STEM fields for many years to come.</p>
                        <p class="bio-section-body">In 2016, Ms. Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama, the highest civilian honor in the United States.</p>
